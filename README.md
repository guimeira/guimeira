## Hey there, I'm Gui! 👋
I'm a Senior Software Engineer currently working at [Bilt Rewards](bilt.com).

In my repository list, you'll find all kinds of random things I have built over the years: from school projects to small personal side projects to repos that I forked just so I could fix something and submit a pull request.

Here are some of the ones I find the most interesting:

🕹️ [fpg8](https://github.com/guimeira/fpg8): an implementation of a Chip8 emulator in Verilog. The emulator runs on an FPGA and communicates with a Java application running on a computer over serial port. The Java application loads games into the memory of the emulator, sends keystrokes (so you can actually play some games) and it can even stop the emulator and inspect the status of each register for debugging. I wrote this as a project for one of the courses I took at the Worcester Polytechinic Institute and it is by far the school project I'm the most proud of.

✏️ [xkcdify](https://github.com/guimeira/xkcdify): this is an Inkscape plugin written in Python. It adds a bit of randomness to curves. You can use it to draw comics in a style similar to xkcd.

⚙️ [rinha-compilador-2023](https://github.com/guimeira/rinha-compilador-2023) (🇧🇷 docs in Portuguese): a compiler for a small functional language I wrote for a [compiler competition](https://github.com/aripiprazole/rinha-de-compiler). It outputs Java bytecode with the help of the asm library and then executes it. This was my first attempt at writing a small compiler and I had a ton of fun playing with it.

🚗 [rrtcontrol](https://github.com/guimeira/rrtcontrol): an interactive visualization of the vehicle model proposed in [this paper](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/Web/People/motionplanning/reading/PlanningforDynamicVeh-1.pdf). I also built this during my Master's studies at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI).

👁️ [stereo-tuner](https://github.com/guimeira/stereo-tuner): a simple GTK application I wrote back when I was using OpenCV's tools for processing stereoscopic images. It offers a simple GUI so you can tune the parameters of each one of the algorithms.

🍎 [trabalho-fruitbots](https://github.com/guimeira/trabalho-fruitbots) (🇧🇷 docs in Portuguese): this is a project I assigned to my students back when I was teaching an introductory Python course. I built a simple graphical interface with an arena containing two bots and several fruits, each one being worth a different number of points. Each group of students had to code the "AI" of a bot in Python. Then, we held a bot tournament in class, where the students' algorithms got to compete against each other. It was a lot of fun! If you're teaching programming classes, give this a try.

🕸️ [cytoscape-snap-to-grid](https://github.com/guimeira/cytoscape-snap-to-grid): an extension for the Cytoscape.js library that adds snap-to-grid functionality and grid lines.
